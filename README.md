Project: Provisioning an AWS EC2 instance with Terraform and configuring it with Ansible

Step 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering

I identified the need for a new development environment to run our web applications on AWS.
I  also defined the desired configuration management tasks, such as installing software, configuring settings, and setting up users and permissions.

Step 2: Terraform Setup

I installed Terraform on my local development machine and initialized a new Terraform project in a version control repository.
I created a Terraform configuration file (in HCL or HashiCorp Configuration Language) that described the desired AWS resources, such as the EC2 instance, security groups, and networking settings.
I used Terraform commands to create, update, and delete AWS resources based on the configuration file.
I tested the Terraform configuration locally using the terraform init, terraform validate, and terraform plan commands to ensure that the desired resources were defined correctly and that there were no syntax errors.

Step 3: Provisioning the EC2 Instance with Terraform

I used the terraform apply command to provision the EC2 instance on AWS based on the Terraform configuration.
I monitored the Terraform output for any errors or warnings during the provisioning process.
Once the EC2 instance was successfully provisioned, I obtained the public IP address and other details from the Terraform output for further configuration.
Step 4: Ansible Setup

I installed Ansible on my local development machine and created a new Ansible playbook in the same version control repository as the Terraform configuration.
I defined tasks in the Ansible playbook that described the desired configuration management tasks, such as installing software, configuring settings, and setting up users and permissions.
I used Ansible inventory files to specify the target hosts, in this case, the provisioned EC2 instance.

Step 5: Configuring the EC2 Instance with Ansible

I used the ansible-playbook command to execute the Ansible playbook against the EC2 instance, specifying the inventory file and the playbook file.
Ansible connected to the EC2 instance via SSH and executed the defined tasks in the playbook.
I monitored the Ansible output for any errors or warnings during the configuration process.
Once the Ansible playbook was successfully executed, the EC2 instance was configured according to the defined tasks.
Step 6: Testing and Validation

I accessed the EC2 instance via SSH to verify that the desired software was installed, settings were configured correctly, and users and permissions were set up as expected.
I ran tests on the web applications hosted on the EC2 instance to ensure that they were functioning properly and meeting the defined requirements.
I documented the configuration changes made by Terraform and Ansible, including the version control commits, Terraform state files, and Ansible playbook files, for future reference and troubleshooting.

Step 7: Maintenance and Monitoring

I set up monitoring and alerting tools, such as  Grafana, to monitor the health and performance of the EC2 instance and the web applications running on it.
I established a regular maintenance schedule to apply security patches, updates, and backups to the EC2 instance.
I participated in a rotating on-call schedule to ensure 24/7 availability of the development environment and promptly addressed any issues or incidents that occurred.
Overall, this project involved using Terraform for provisioning the EC2 instance on AWS and Ansible for configuring the instance according to the defined requirements.
